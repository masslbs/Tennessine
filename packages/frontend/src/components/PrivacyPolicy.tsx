            not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access,
            steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to

            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>How to exercise your rights</h4>

          <p>
            To exercise these rights, you can contact us by visiting
            info@mass.market, or by referring to the contact details at the

          </p>

          <p>
            Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate and
            authorised agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a
            request from an authorised agent that does not submit proof that
            they have been validly authorised to act on your behalf in
            accordance with applicable laws.
          </p>

          <h4>Verification process</h4>

          <p>
            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
            determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
            in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
            provide information so that we can match it with information you
            have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of
            request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
            that we can match the information you provide with the information
            we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
            communication method (e.g., email) that you have previously provided
            to us. We may also use other verification methods as the
            circumstances dictate. We will only use personal information
            provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to
            make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting
            additional information from you for the purposes of verification.
            However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information
            already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional
            information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for
            security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such
            additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
            you.
          </p>

          <p>
