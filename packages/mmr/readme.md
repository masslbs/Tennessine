This is a persistent
[Merkle Mountain Range](https://github.com/opentimestamps/opentimestamps-server/blob/master/doc/merkle-mountain-range.md)
implementation that stives for simplicity and readability. It is not optimized
for performance.

### There are some footguns

- The tree xor's the hashes of leafs to generate the parent hash. This is not
  secure if the leafs are not trusted and can be manipulated by an attacker.
- You can only grow the tree by pushing values to it.
- You can't remove values from the tree.

### Impovements

- batch operations would be more performant
